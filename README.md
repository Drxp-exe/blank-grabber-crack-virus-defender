🔓 Blank-Grabber-Crack-Virus-Defender 🚀
A powerful multi-functional tool designed for bypassing security systems, simulating attacks, and defending against viruses in an intuitive interface! 🦠💻

Allow Antivirus Detection 🛡️
When running the tool, your antivirus software may flag the script as suspicious or harmful. This is normal because the tool uses techniques often associated with hacking and security testing.

Important: Your antivirus may mistakenly identify it as a threat because it mimics activities commonly associated with malware.
If this happens, don't panic! It’s a false positive due to the nature of the tool.
To prevent the antivirus from blocking the script, you’ll need to temporarily disable it or whitelist the file in your antivirus settings.
In some cases, you may also need to purchase a Windows Defender license to avoid the detection entirely. 🔐
